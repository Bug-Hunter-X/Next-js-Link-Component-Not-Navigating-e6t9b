# Next.js Link Component Not Navigating

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the Next.js `Link` component where it fails to navigate to the intended URL. The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The `Link` component is rendered, however clicking the link does not update the browser's URL or trigger the routing behavior expected in Next.js.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the `Link` component's `href` prop is correctly set to a valid Next.js route and checking for any conflicting JavaScript or CSS that might be interfering with the default behavior of the component.  Also verify that you are using the correct import for Link from 'next/link'
